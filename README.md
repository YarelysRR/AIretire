#AIretire: Simplifying Seniors' Lives, One Service at a Time.

## About the Project

AIretire is a senior-centric digital assistant designed to simplify the lives of seniors by providing a comprehensive platform for managing personal and financial information. The application integrates secure document management, AI-driven form processing, and empathetic interactions to create a user-friendly experience tailored to the needs of older adults. Built using Streamlit and Azure AI services, AIretire features a prompt pre-processing layer that auto-corrects user inputs, redacts sensitive data, and validates prompts to ensure safe, accurate, and optimized communication.

The application supports voice and form hybrid interfaces, enabling seniors to interact with the system in a way that is most comfortable for them. With built-in fraud detection and accessibility tools such as text-to-speech and high-contrast mode, AIretire aims to deliver trustworthy services while addressing the unique challenges faced by seniors and their authorized caregivers in managing their personal affairs.
